# Fourier Cosine Method for Option Pricing

This project implements the Fourier Cosine (COS) method for pricing European options.  
It also includes an analysis of the numerical error and comments on the results.

## 📌 Features

- Implementation of the COS method for option pricing
- Error analysis and convergence study
- Visualization of pricing and error behavior

## 📁 Structure

- `main.py`: COS method implementation
- `error_analysis.py`: Compare COS approximation with reference values
- `figures/`: Plots showing convergence and pricing accuracy

## 🚀 Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
