# Fourier Cosine Method for Option Pricing

This project implements the Fourier Cosine (COS) method for pricing European options.  
It also includes an analysis of the numerical error and comments on the results.

## 📌 Features

- Implementation of the COS method for option pricing
- Error analysis and convergence study
- Visualization of pricing and error behavior

## 📁 Structure

- `main.py`: COS method implementation
- `src`: ALl python functions we use to do our project
- `tests`: To test our model
- `figures/`: Plots showing convergence and pricing accuracy
